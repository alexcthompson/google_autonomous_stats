This repo contains a short Jupyter Notebook building simple graphs of Google's autonomous driving program miles.  Mileage, other stats, and interesting vignettes are [published monthly by Google](https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/reports/.  I have taken the additional step of compiling these results together into an Excel sheet in this repo, used by the Jupyter Notebook as it's data set.  If you like, grab the data and play with it!
